This module is a module to analyze and provides tools to help purchasers
to change Odoo supplier invoices when they receives the invoice from the supplier.

It is helpull in the following Use Case:

- You create purchase orders with many lines in Odoo to generate and send the purchase order to the
  supplier, via Odoo.
- you change quantities in some picking lines when you receive the goods and confirm the picking.
- you generate a draft supplier invoice, based on the products you received.
  (Invoice Policy : Base on delivery)

- Then you have to compare the draft theoritical invoice with the real supplier invoice
  and apply changes in the theoritical invoice to match with the real supplier invoice.

**Reflections regarding community work**

This module is an alternative to OCA modules, mainly ``account_invoice_import_invoice2data``.
The reasons of the development of a specific module are the following :

- To use the OCA solution, we need to install 9 modules for a total of 2500 lines of code.
  ``account_invoice_import``, ``account_invoice_import_invoice2data``, ``unece``, etc...
  while this module contains less than 300 lines of python code.

- The current invoice2data OCA modules doesn't handle line analysis. A Work In Progress
  is present since April 2022 here https://github.com/OCA/edi/ for the V14 version.
  It is unmerged, not available for GRAP branches (V12 / V16) and doesn't handle multiple
  discounts.

- The OCA wizard is very complex, because it handles a lot of use cases, while the
  wizard of this module is very simple and handles all the use cases of the workflow
  "Update the odoo invoice, based on supplier invoice".

**The Odoo Invoice generated from the Purchase Order**

* Go to "Invoicing > Vendors > Bills"

    * Click on "Import" button

    .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grap/grap-odoo-business-supplier-invoice/12.0/account_invoice_invoice2data/static/description/wizard_step_1_pdf_import.png

2. Product mapping

    * The wizard will guess producs, based on the ``product_code`` of the selected supplier.

    * If the supplierinfo is not found, a step ask to mention which product corresponds
      to the invoice line.
      you have to link each supplier invoice line to an existing product (or create a new one).
    * Click on "Map Products"

    .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grap/grap-odoo-business-supplier-invoice/12.0/account_invoice_invoice2data/static/description/wizard_step_2_product_mapping.png

3. Summary before update

    The last screen display all the changes that will be done on the Odoo invoice.

* The extra lines has been disabled. (quantity has been set to 0.)
* All the lines has been reordered.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

**Work to do before sharing in OCA**

* Move in a dedicated module:
    * ``_get_extra_products`` in ``wizards/wizard_invoice2data_import_line.py``

* Remove dependencies to triple discount modules, if there have been introduced.
